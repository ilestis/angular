## AngularJS Proof of Concept

A simple proof of concept using AngularJS along with AngularStrap, to get a grasp of the awesomness that is AngularJS.

# Installation

1. Clone the git onto your computer or server. You will need to create a VirtualHost with Apache for example, simply pointing to /path/to/angular
2. Open up the data/ folder and modify the content.
3. Add jpg images in img/albums/{album-id}/[1-n] and a img/albums/{album-id}/thumbnail.png accordingy to the albums you set in data/albums.json
4. Test and enjoy

# Future updates

- Connecting to a couchdb instead of having pictures and albums in JSON files
- Admin interface to interact with said DB (REST with PHP/ROR/node.js/whatever)
- Better visuals (this is a test app!)
- Multilingual
- More and more and more (well, maybe, we'll see about the more stuff)
